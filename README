openntpd-arachsys
=================

This is an alternative multiplatform repackaging of OpenBSD's openntpd,
compatible with Linux glibc, Linux musl, FreeBSD, NetBSD and DragonFly,
as well as the original OpenBSD.

It is actively maintained, includes a number of fixes and quality-of-life
improvements and isn't obfuscated by autoconf, automake and libtool.

Portability is hard and autotools are (perhaps) justified if you need to
target obsolete and obscure platforms, but the informal consensus between
modern free unix systems is increasingly broad. An NTP daemon needs to
make kernel-specific clock adjustments, but there is no reason the rest
of the code can't be portable without #ifdef soup - as demonstrated by
the simplicity of the adaptations here.


Building and installing
-----------------------

Run 'make install' at the top of the source tree to install ntpd and
ntpq in /bin. You can set DESTDIR, PREFIX and/or BINDIR to install in
a different location, and set MANDIR to install man pages along with
the binaries.

The privilege-separation user, configuration file path, control socket
location and drift file path can be changed with USERNAME, CONFFILE,
CTLSOCKET and DRIFTFILE respectively.

The code should build unmodified on sufficiently up-to-date versions of
Linux glibc, Linux musl, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and DragonFly using
either clang or gcc, and either BSD or GNU make.

TLS constraints require libtls from libressl and the Makefile assumes this
can be found on the standard include and link paths. Override CFLAGS and
LDFLAGS in the usual way if it is hidden elsewhere. libtls can be built
standalone or statically without replacing the system libssl and libcrypto.

On Linux, glibc didn't provide strlcat() until version 2.38 in July 2023,
so compatibility may be delayed on distributions which confuse stability
with obsolescence.
